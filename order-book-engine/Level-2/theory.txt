Now with Level-2, these are the new things:
1. We will group order of same price and excude them with time priority
2. Sort order book for best bid ask ( using map)
3. for fast lookup unordered_map
4. Hence along with previous one these are newer files: a. trade.h( to actully execute a trade ) b. PriceLevel.h
5. Things to note:
5.1 : The use of header is that it will act as interface only and very basic to nill logic is needed to be written in this
6. In real world a net of order may not be executed together hence count of order left for each stock must be kept
