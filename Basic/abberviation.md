# Terms used to understand the logic

### 1. Spot-price
`The current price of market`
### 2. Strike-price
`The Price at which one would have brought the securities ( in lots ) `
### 3. Intrinsic Value
``
The Amount which we would receive if we just sell the option
For Call Option => max(spot-strike,0)
For Put Option => max(strike-spot,0)
``

### 4. Extrinsic value
` 
Extrinsic value => Option Premium - Intrinsic Value 

The theta decay effects the call option is T (Time to expiry ) is inversery propotional, meaning if the time to expiry is
big then decay is smaller but since T tends to 0 hence the decay increases resulting in lossing the value of premium
`
### 5. Risk neutral probablity :
`
a.Risk-neutral probability is a mathematically adjusted probability measure under which all assets grow at the risk-free rate, allowing options to be priced without considering investor risk preferences.
