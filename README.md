# Its my theory page along with practical implimentation as one which have seen my porfolio would get an idea of my skiils which i want to implement in model making
# Quant Developer Project Roadmap

## 01-order-book-engine/
Build a full Level-2 limit order book in C++.

## 02-matching-engine/
Implement exchange-style order matching (price–time priority).

## 03-market-data-feedhandler/
Parse and process streaming tick data and update the order book in real time.

## 04-market-data-replayer/
Replay historical market data at configurable speeds for testing.

## 05-execution-algorithms/
Implement execution algorithms: TWAP, VWAP, POV, and basic smart order routing.

## 06-backtesting-engine/
Create an event-driven backtesting system with realistic fill simulation.

## 07-option-pricing-engine/
Implement Black–Scholes, Monte Carlo simulation, Greeks, and implied volatility solver.

## 08-risk-and-pnl/
Add PnL tracking, risk measures, and exposure calculations.

## 09-low-latency-infrastructure/
Implement lock-free queues, memory pools, batching techniques, and microbenchmarks.

## 10-strategy-framework/
Create a plugin-style framework to run strategies on top of the backtester and feed handler.

## 11-simulation-environment/
Simulate market microstructure including latency, slippage, queue position, and spread dynamics.

## 12-utilities/
Common utilities including time handlers, logging, configuration loader, and performance benchmarks.
